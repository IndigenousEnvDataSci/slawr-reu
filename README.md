# ðŸŒ± SLAWR REU

Welcome to the Github repository for the SLAWR REU indigenous environmental data science workshop! Github repositories are places to store code, files, and revision history. The files we will work with today, including R markdowns and data sets stored as CSV, are all included here.

## ðŸ’» Pre-workshop setup

1.  [Follow along these slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGq6pZ7BrA/92e9_nEvKlqxDAIsPV7l3Q/view?utm_content=DAGq6pZ7BrA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h3fa4c59111) to download R and R Studio, get your environment set up, and customize the appearance of RStudio.
2.  Links to download: [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
3. Optionally, if you don't want to download the programs to your computer, you can make an account with [Rstudio cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). 
4.  Use the 'Module 0' worksheet, [linked below](#follow-along-worksheets), to follow along a check list for getting set up

## ðŸŽ£ Morning session

We will start with the file `AM_getting_started_in_R.Rmd` and follow along with live coding to get introduced to R. The 'Module 1' worksheet is a guide to follow along with this code.

To view the live code we worked through in the morning, see `AM_getting_started_in_R_live_code.Rmd`

### Follow along worksheets: {#follow-along-worksheets}

These worksheets will be printed out for in person use as guides to follow along with code and check for understanding. The online versions open as Google docs, and can be copied to edit.

-   [Module 0: Getting started in R](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iAxIsAVO68G-PeDztxGkRANG_rK-606z0iRZoP3Za80/edit?usp=sharing)
-   [Module 1: Monitoring Fisheries for Heavy Metal Contaminants](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Td4zWCFjbSshEphRP0kEXXZgnxKc5Dty88cdLkfjGVY/edit?usp=sharing)

## ðŸ“Š Afternoon session

We will read about the data sets in the document `PM_data_vis_case_studies.Rmd`, and select one to explore and create plots from. With a team, create plots along with a story about why the data is important and what you would want to communicate to the community it belongs to. Add to the slide show: [hum.link/data-vis-slides](https://hum.link/data-vis-slides)

You may want to reference the [ggplot cheatsheet](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

## Want to keep learning?

There are many resources online to continue learning about how to use R for environmental data science, and we are here to support you! To continue the activity started today, you can work through the extended [module on monitoring fisheries for heavy metal contaminants](https://indigenousenvdatasci.github.io/MOD1/mod1_intro.html). This includes the steps we did in the morning session, as well as further data analysis and discussion on the decision making for indigenous communities.

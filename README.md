3.  Use the 'Module 0' worksheet, [linked below](#follow-along-worksheets), to follow along a check list for getting set up

## ðŸŽ£ Morning session

We will start with the file `AM_getting_started_in_R.Rmd` and follow along with live coding to get introduced to R. 
The 'Module 1' worksheet is a guide to follow along with this code. 

## ðŸ“Š  Afternoon session

We will read about the data sets in the document `PM_data_vis_case_studies.Rmd`, and select one to explore and create plots from. With a team, you will present these plots at the end of the day, along with a story about why the data is important and what you would want to communicate to the community it belongs to. Your presentation could be a slide show or a knit R markdown document. 

### Follow along worksheets:

These worksheets will be printed out for in person use as guides to follow along with code and check for understanding. The online versions open as Google docs, and can be copied to edit.

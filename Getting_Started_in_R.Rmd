## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Load package 

"Packages" are computer code that someone wrote to do a particular thing. By loading a package, R downloads that code, so that you can do that thing yourself. Think of packages as tools for you to use in R that aren't automatically part of R when you first installed it. The package below allows you to do  more things in R, and makes coding much easier! 

Below, we install the package "tidyverse" which we'll use to organize data and to make pretty graphs. You only need to install a package once, but every time you use R you will have to load from the library using `library()`
 

```{r}
# if running for the first time, install the package 
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse") 

# every time you start R, load your package using library() 
library(tidyverse)

```
